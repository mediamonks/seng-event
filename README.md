## Documentation

View the [generated documentation](https://rawgit.com/MediaMonks/seng-event/master/doc/typedoc/index.html).


## Building

In order to build seng-event, ensure that you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

Clone a copy of the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MediaMonks/seng-event.git
```

Change to the seng-event directory:
```sh
cd seng-event
```

Install dev dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

Use one of the following main scripts:
```sh
npm run build   		# build this project
npm run generate   		# generate all artifacts (compiles ts, webpack, docs and coverage)
npm run typings			# install .d.ts dependencies (done on install)
npm run test-unit    	# run the unit tests
npm run validate		# runs validation scripts, including test, lint and coverage check
npm run lint			# run tslint on this project
npm run doc				# generate typedoc and yuidoc documentation
npm run typescript-npm	# just compile the typescript output used in the npm module
```

When installing this module, it adds a pre-commit hook, that runs the `validate`
script before committing, so you can be sure that everything checks out.
